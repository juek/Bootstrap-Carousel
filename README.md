## Fork of [Bootstrap-Carousel plugin](https://github.com/Typesetter/Bootstrap-Carousel) for [Typesetter CMS](https://github.com/Typesetter/Typesetter)
compatible with Bootstrap 4

1. based on code from http://www.typesettercms.com/Plugins/232_Bootstrap_Carousel_Gallery
2. uses "img" instead of "background-image" for slides (like in Bootstrap 4 carousel demo)
3. does not use custom styles for controls, indicators, captions
4. contents some trick for carousel height (empty or 100% is equivalent to auto)
5. add "alt" (=caption) for "img"
